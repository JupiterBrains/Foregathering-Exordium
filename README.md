Foregathering: Exordium was created in two weeks for the Acerola Game Jam, and is the first entry in the Forgathering series. I hope that this game gets across some of the general ideas and themes that I want to explore with this series. This is only the second game I ever sat down and 'finished' and I can say this is something I am proud of, especially given the constraints.

This game uses several sound packs from: Totsnuk, Tom Music, Sulo Sounds, Atelier Magicae, Helton Yan, and Leohpaz. All of the packs the assets were used from can be found and downloaded in this collection:
